# franioV3.0

Bit board based chess engine in C.\
franioV2 is not really smart, therefore I decided to rewrite it and improve some things many things will be ripped from the second version.

# TO DO
Move generation improvement (current improvements in tests.txt)\
Make move functions (all and captures (for quiescence search))\
Material hashing\
Dinamically alocated move list\
Perft
